    "scikit-learn or sklearn is an extremely simple and neat machine learning (ML) library in Python. It isn't the best library but it does everything very decently. Its biggest strength is that it provides a unified interface for almost all ML algorithms. Almost all (supervised) ML models implement the following two methods:\n",

An example API for LinearSVC can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html#sklearn.svm.LinearSVC). There're other methods, too. But they're much less frequently used."
