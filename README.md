Lab Questions for [2301793-2019 class at Chulalongkorn University](https://classroom.google.com/c/NDg2MjYzOTE0OTda) (Special Topics in CS - Modern Machine Learning)

This repo contains 8 labs for the class in the form of Jupyter notebooks. You can either run in your local machine or in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true).

To import the code to Google Colab, please follow [this guide](https://course.fast.ai/start_colab.html) (you can skip step 2). Most of the libraries should have already been pre-installed in Colab.

### Lab 1: Introduction (1 Feb 2020)

Getting started with popular machine learning libraries and concepts. For this course, we'll mainly use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 

### Lab 2: Linear Model (15 Feb 2020)


### Lab 3: Support Vector Machines (22 Feb 2020)


### Lab 4: Artificial Neural Networks (29 Feb 2020)


### Lab 5: Tree-based Algorithms (7 Mar 2020)


### Lab 6: Unsupervised Learning (14 Mar 2020)


### Lab 7: Learning Techniques (21 Mar 2020)

### Lab 8: Reinforcement Learning (28 Mar 2020)
